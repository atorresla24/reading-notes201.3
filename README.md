## Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops from switch statements on

* If...else statements are used to check conditions and the code that is ran depends on whether the first condition is true otherwise if false the second code will be executed
* Switch statements- starts with a **switch value** 
  - each variable will indicate a possible value and will determine what code is ran
* Purpose is to present user with different message depending on level in example
* Data types can be converted behind the scenes with type coercion 
* JavaScript uses **weak typing** because datat types can change 
* Other languages use strong typing
* Due to coercion every value can be treated as true or false
* Unary operator- returns a result with just one operand
* Loop types:
  - for 
  - while
  - do while
* Consist of:
  - keyword 
  - condtion(keyword)
  - opening/closing brakcets
  - code to execute
* Loop counters:
  - initialization
  - condition 
  - update
